# Your Project Title

My project title is called "Myportfolio" 


## Description 

This project is a simple Portfolio built with three html pages. The first page "Home" is the heart of this portfolio.
The "Home" page includes a navbar where is possibile to navigate through the portfolio and its links. It's the main page of the website
and has a Bio section called "About me". I've used a very clear font to make sure it's clean and readable. I've choosen the courier font
to write the description of "About me" because based on the "fictional/comic book" style of this website I think it was a good match.
To create this page first of all I've picked a futurist background image which I've place inside the html body. After doing so I wanted to
create a container to have the main box where my "AboutMe/Bio" would be placed. Inside the main container has you can see I've placed a picture
which is about my favorite fictional character Marvin from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". The paragraph in the Bio are actually the 
lyrics of Radiohead's song "Paranoid Android" which was inspired by Marvin character has the band once claimed during an interview. When we move 
to the "Portfolio" page using the navbar here we will have all my work that I've done has web developer but since this is just a demo I've used a 
dark humour pic of Marvin instead. The "Portfolio" section has a navbar has well so you are able to navigate through the website anytime no matter 
what page you're in. I've done the same for the "Contact" page. The "Contact" page is a very simple box where you can submit your name, your email 
and send me a message so we are able to keep in touch for any sort of future collaboration! You can see that the background picture that resides in 
the body of the html was applied to all three pages. The container white box was applied to all three pages as well. You can notice that the white 
container fits the page automatically based on what's inside of it. I've achieved this setting giving to the container the "height:auto" value.
